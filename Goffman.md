# Goffman

## Symbolic interactionism

+ Study of how people interact with one another to create symbolic worlds
+ How these worlds influence individual behaviors

## The Presentation of Self in Everyday Life (1956)

+ His first and most famous book
+ Leading scholar of the micro-sociology of everyday life
+ Centred around the dramaturgical approach
+ Understand human action by seeing actors on a 'social stage'

### Impression management

+ Process by which we seek to influence how others perceive us
+ Projecting an 'idealized image' of ourselves
+ Front stage vs Back stage (vs Off stage)

#### Front Stage

+ Area of social interaction where impression management performances occur
+ Performer attempts to cultivate a particular appearance or image for a particular audience
+ Many different 'stages' in our lives for different 'audiences'
+ The setting
+ Furniture, d√©cor, physical layout
+ Insignia, clothing, gestures, posture

##### 'Dramatic realization'

+ '...if the individual's activity is to become significant to others, he must mobilise his activity so that it will express during the interaction what he wishes to convey.'
+ Making an act highly visible e.g. shop assistants

##### 'Idealization' (p.34)

+ Performance will 'tend to incorporate and exemplify the officially accredited values of the society'
+ Positive idealization e.g conspicuously rich or negative idealization e.g. fashionably poor

#### Back stage

+ Area of social interaction away from the eyes of an audience
+ People can rehearse and rehash their performances, or step "out of character"

#### What do we make of the roles that we play?

+ Sincere
  + We actually believe in the role we play
  + Sense of self aligns with projected self

+ Contrived
  + Cynical about the image we project
  + Don't believe the role reflects our "true self"

+ Continuum
  + Most of our "performances" are somewhere in between

### Goffman's research method

+ Interpretivism
+ We may never actually get to see people's real identities unless we spend considerable time with them during their day to day lives
+ Ethnography
  + Study of people and cultures through observation and interactions
  + Interpreting human behavior - goals, motivations, meanings
  + Explores social phenomena rather than testing hypotheses

## Criticisms

+ Overly impressionistic
+ Unsystematic
+ Imprecise and cannot be easily replicated
+ Too concerned with small group interactions
+ Works better with small, tightly-knit groups than larger, looser ones

#### Goffman's enduring legacy

+ Sensitising readers to nuances, depths and subtle hidden dimensions of ordinary events
+ Accentuated our understanding of the performative dimension of our everyday lives
+ More profound than ever in our <u>social media infused age</u>
